# Motivation
## => *ubc do not calculate gpa for studentsssss*

To be completely honest, this is probably the most useful personal project I've ever done. Useful in the sense that __I will actually use it in my life__. Most personal projects are for extracurricular learning (?), or even just for resume :joy:.  

Anyways, this project allows UBC students to **get their GPA in less than 30 seconds**! If you are a first year user that just got into UBC with less than 50 credits in your transcript, it might be convenient to calculate it manually on a GPA calculator website. However, if you are a fourth year old head with like 120 credits and some 1 credit lab courses, it might not be so easy anymore.

# Implementation

This project uses `selenium` webdriver package to click/navigate through webpages and `BeautifulSoup` to parse webpage HTML tags. 

### Login
The program will ask for your username and password, and use `send_keys()` function to fill it out in each text input area.

### Grabbing the Grades
Basically, the grades are all stored in a table on the UBC SSC page and the program finds the grades and their corresponding credit number using the following code. 

{% highlight python %}
smallSoup = soup.find('div', {'id' : 'tabs-all'})
subjectData = smallSoup.find_all('td', {'class' : 'listRow'})
subjectDataGrade = smallSoup.find_all('td', {'class': 'listRow grade'})
{% endhighlight %}

Then, it's just a `for` loop to accumulate all the grades and account for some edge cases! Quick and simple program that makes our lives easier :grinning:.
