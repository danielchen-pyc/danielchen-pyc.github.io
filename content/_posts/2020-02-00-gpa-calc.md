### Motivation: *ubc do not calculate gpa for studentsssss*

To be completely honest, this is probably the most useful personal project I've ever done. Useful in the sense that I will actually use it in my life. Most personal projects are for extracurricular learning (?), or even just for resume :joy:.  

Anyways, this project allows UBC students to get their GPA **in less than 30 seconds**! If you are a first year user that just got into UBC with less than 50 credits in your transcript, it might be convenient to calculate it manually on a GPA calculator website. However, if you are a fourth year old head with like 120 credits and some 1 credit lab courses, it might not be so easy anymore.
