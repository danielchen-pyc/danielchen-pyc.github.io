# Introduction

Because of the heavily secured system at Sony Pictures, no one is allowed to upload media (files, photos, recordings, etc.) to any external website, including Google and all its services. However, there are also many artists that needs visuals (screenshots, videos) to communicate effectively. One project that has been proposed for a long time is an internal tool that allows employees to send screenshots/recordings fast and conveniently. 

I didn't know much `Javascript` and didn't even know what a Gnome Shell extension is before this project. I was assigned to research in this area and create an extension to solve this problem. 

<br/>

# Structure
The architecture of this extension system is very simple - a server, a listener, and an extension. The server is an [ActiveMQ][1] server, an open source, multi-protocol message queue server. The listener is written in `Python` using the [`stomppy`][2] API, which was later updated to use the internal [wrapper API][3] that I wrote for the company. The Gnome Shell extension is a application, written in `Javascript`, that is attached to the desktop environment Gnome and able to process more customized features that should not be in the Linux core. In conclusion, we have three main components in this iteration: 

- [JavaScript Extension](#js)
- [Python Listener](#listener)
- [ActiveMQ Server](#activemq)

We will also talk about the relationships between [JS extension - Python Listener](#js-python)


<h2 id="js">Javascript Gnome Shell Extension</h2>
This extension is written in a specific implementation of pure `Javascript`, `GJS`, which is a `Javascript` [binding][5] for Gnome Desktop Environment. Gnome shell extensions can help the desktop environment manage or customize applications, UI, widgets by integrating into the Gnome interface itself. They are connected to the Gnome shell and is designed to extend the functionality of Gnome DE. 

To create an extension, developers would just have to follow these simple steps: 

1. Add an extension folder at `~/.local/share/Gnome-shell/extensions/` or `/usr/share/Gnome-shell/extensions/`.
2. In the folder, create the following files
- `metadata.json`
- `extension.js`
- `prefs.js` (optional - for GTK extension settings)
- `stylesheet.css` (optional - for styling)
3. In `metadata.json`, add your extension configuration. This lets the Gnome DE know what/how to add your extension to the DE. It should look similar to this: 
```
{
    "url" : "",
    "uuid" : "extension@extension.com",
    "name" : "extension name",
    "description" : "description",
    "shell-version" : [
        "3.28", "3.32"
    ],
    "version" : 1.0
}
```

4. `extension.js` is the main script that designs the logic, UI, I/O, etc. of the extension. There are three functions that the Gnome DE looks for when running the file: 

{% highlight javascript %}
function init () {
    // initialize any variables / functions
}

function enable () {
    // triggers when the extension is enabled and added to the DE
}

function disable() {
    // triggers when the extension is disabled and removed from the DE
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then, the extension is basically set up! The [GJS Tutorial][6] and [GJS Documentation][10] have many useful tips and resources. 


<h2 id="listener">Python Listener</h2>

The `Python` listener is built around the [`stomppy` API][7], which is the first component that the extension interacts with in the hierarchy of the message queue system. We specify the server and the topic we want to listen to, which is ActiveMQ and a topic we set up for this application, in this case. Whenever a message is pushed to the destination topic from the publisher, the listener will pick up the message and decide what to do with it. The listener basically acts like a infinite loop with functions being called when there are incoming messages from the queue. 

In the original version, before the [wrapper API][3] has been developed, I used something similar to the following. 

{% highlight python %}
import stomp

# Sender
conn = stomp.Connection()
conn.connect('admin', 'password', wait=True)
conn.send(body=' '.join(sys.argv[1:]), destination='/queue/test')
conn.disconnect()

# Receiver
c.subscribe('/queue/test', 123)
{% endhighlight %}


<h2 id="activemq">ActiveMQ Server</h2>
The ActiveMQ server is the server the `Python` listener and publisher connects to. It is an open-sourced, `Java`-based message broker that supports software/hardware integration in multiple languages and frameworks. It is also used in a lot of IoT devices and large scale cross platform projects. 


<h2 id="js-python">JS extension - Python Listener Relationship</h2>

When a machine starts, Gnome starts, along with all the enabled Gnome shell extensions. When we initialize the extension, we also run the `Python` listener using 

{% highlight javascript %}
process = Gio.Subprocess.new(['python', LISTENER_PATH], 0);
process.wait_async(null, null);
{% endhighlight %}

This basically runs the `Python` listener in a new process **asynchronously** using [`wait_async`][4], a asynchronous version of `Gio.Subprocess.wait()`. We use `process.force_exit();` when the extension is disabled, to make sure there isn't any dangling processes running around. 

In the this version of the extension, whenever the `Python` listener receives a message from the queue/server, it *writes to a `JSON` file*. The extension, on the other hand, *reads the the `JSON` file every 1 second* and determine if there is a new message. We use `Gio.file_new_for_path` to get the file from path and [`Gio.File.load_contents_async`][9] to read the file asynchronously, since synchronous read/writes would create an even larger computational load to Gnome shell and the machine. 

{% highlight javascript %}
let file = Gio.file_new_for_path(JSON);
file.load_contents_async(null, function(file, res) {
    try {
        contents = file.load_contents_finish(res)[1];
        try{
            contents = JSON.parse(contents);
        } catch(e) {
            log(e);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        /* Error will only occur if file doesn't exist or has been corrupted somehow */
        log(error);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that there are a lot of reading/writing going on, and there is a `JSON` file in between, which is definitely not the best way to do it. I had to pay a lot of attention to locking the file to prevent race conditions, limiting the file size so that I/O doesn't take too long, parsing the `JSON` and a whole lot of other issues that come with file I/O. The extension also has to read from a `JSON` file every `RATE` seconds, which creates a huge load on the extension, and subsequently on the Gnome shell itself. This problem will eventually be improved, or *eliminated*, shall I say, with the [DBus Connection][8].

# UI/UX Design

UI/UX design for a Gnome shell extension is quite different than `Qt`, which I am fairly experienced in from writing/debugging plugins in Sony Pictures Imageworks. This is the structure of a Gnome shell extension and the packages/toolkits that contribute to the UI of it.

</div>


For a Gnome shell extension, it is most convenient to inherit existing UI components and make modifications from there. Developers can definitely design their own UI components, but it requires a lot more work, might be incompatible with Gnome shell itself, or buggy if not designed properly. Gnome shell itself is built with those UI components, and it is an [open source project][11]. All of the components are written in `GJS` and located [here][12]. The most popular UI component for extension development is the [PopupMenu][13], which is perfect for a popup widget in the taskbar.
