    今天存到第半桶金！就用回台灣來慶祝。而且回台灣還可以給我爸養，開始付自己的學費、房租的時候，才發現之前多麼的幸福。

    昨天跟Sony的同事吃飯慶祝端午節，然後去Jeren家擼貓，lollipop超可愛 :)
    <br/>每個人人都超好，也讓我感覺到台灣的溫暖，因為來這邊第一次節慶有人ㄧ起慶祝。意外聽到其實自己在公司裡名聲蠻好的，也讓我很開心。
    <br/>realization of the week: 寧願把薪水位階看輕一點，做自己喜歡的、收穫多的，也不要去大公司當他們的奴隸。

    got invited to a random boba trip with the backend team today, met new people, they 
    were all so nice :) + i hate econ + 感覺有什麼讓人難過的事情上來這邊宣洩一下就會好很多 + 為什麼
    偏偏要遇到一堆爛人搞砸我的心情 + 當然也有很nice的人，可能我需要be a bit more positive? + (補星期一)
    sayem跟我一起抱怨超多事情，算是國際學生的哀悼ㄅ + he's such a good friend :)

    feeling kinda moody lately. 和很多人聊天，聊工作、聊生活。突然發現我已經一年沒有回台灣了。
    在這邊就是自給自足，放牛吃草。i mean you kinda get constantly loved back home. 
    i'm probably not a kid anymore huh. sounds corny but i dont think i'll worry about this
    if mom is here with me rn.
